# Algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to create some usefull function based on popular algorithms, with the aim of practice programming and implement the mathematics behind these methods.

List of functions:

  - K-means (R and Python)
  - Knn (C++ and Python)
  - Logistic hierarquical model, bayesian approach (Metropolis MCMC) (R)
  - Finite-state Discrete Markov Chain n_states vector (R)
  - Finite-state Discrete Markov Chain n_step vector (R)
  - Power of square matrix (R)
  - Moving Histogram (KDE) (R)
